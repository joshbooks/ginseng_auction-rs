# ginseng_auction-rs
the auction protocol described in http://www.mulix.org/pubs/cloud/ginseng-tr.pdf
implemented in rust.
Right now I'm basically screwing around trying to find a way to do this wildly
inefficient algorithm without insane space complexity. This may be foolish but 
by god it's a good way to learn rust.
